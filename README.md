My name is Sascha Rehberg. I have been working in many different areas over the years, but all that has led me here. Now I am learning how to use github and other coding resources.

Things I have been doing until now (in no specific order):
- Waiter
- Delivery driver (can't recommend)
- Sound-assistant at a theater
- Housekeeping
- Student of literature and philosophy
