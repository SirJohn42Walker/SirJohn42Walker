My name is Sascha Rehberg, I am a thirtysomething living in Munich, Germany. I have been working in many different fields over the years - and all that has led me here. Now I am learning how to use github and other coding resources.

**Incomplete list of things I have been doing until now (in no specific order):**
- Waiter
- Delivery driver (can't recommend)
- Sound-assistant at a theater
- Housekeeping
- Student of literature and philosophy

<br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java... So, basically the foundations of coding.

<br>

In my free time you will find me listening to podcasts and audiobooks while usually doing at least one other thing at the same time.

Should anyone ever want to get into a needlessly detailed discussion about Pen and Paper games, you can reach me at: [rehberg.sascha@gmail.com](mailto:rehberg.sascha@gmail.com).
